Project Euler in Ruby
=====================

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) is a fun place to learn a little math, a little algorithm and a little programming.

The best part of it, IMHO, is the different solutions of a same problem on the forum. I am constantly amazed by all the genius there.
